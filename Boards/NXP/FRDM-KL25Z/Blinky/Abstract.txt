The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS based example for
NXP 'MKL25' series microcontroller using NXP 'FRDM-KL25Z' board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  IRC (Slow Internal Reference Clock)
   - Core Clock =  20.9 MHz

 - 3 LEDs are blinking with a fixed speed.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  ULink2:                          Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULink2
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip

  ULink2 MTB:                      Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK2
                                   shows use of MTB(Micro Trace Buffer)


Selecting "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application:
 1. Start OpenSDA in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed.
 2. Drag and drop "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file to the OpenSDA mass storage device.
 3. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.

Note:
 - "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file is located in folder "OpenSDA".
 - For more information on OpenSDA, refer to FRDM-KL25Z user manual.

MTB(Micro Trace Buffer) Notes
-------------------------------
- DBG_MTB.ini file configures MTB settings, which allows to configure MTB RAM buffer size, buffer position, and flow control.
- MTB allocates user-defined region of the system RAM for storing instruction address change-of-flow data packets.
  Modify MTB position and size to define the used memory region. The position must be a multiple of the buffer size.
  The allocated buffer region cannot be used as application RAM.
